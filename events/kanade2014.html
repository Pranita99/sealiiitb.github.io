	<h2>Current trends in programming languages and research</h2>
		<b>Speaker:</b> Prof. Aditya Kanade, CSA, IISc<br>
		<b>Date:</b> July 11, 2014
		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>
		This is an exciting time for research in programming languages. Many
		recent innovations ranging from smart devices and cloud/web to online
		education and end-user programming are throwing up foundational
		challenges for programming languages technologies. In this talk, I
		will review these recent innovations and identify the central role of
		programming languages in supporting them. I will pose some of the
		foundational research problems in this setting. The talk will then
		discuss a couple of our recent contributions in this space: (1) formal
		analysis of concurrent Android applications [PLDI'14] and (2)
		automated program repair [ICSE'14].
		</p>

		<h3>Speaker bio</h3>
		<p>
		Dr. Aditya Kanade obtained a PhD from the Indian Institute of
		Technology Bombay in 2007, and a BE from the Government College of
		Engineering Pune in 2002, both in computer science and engineering.
		From 2007 to 2009, he was a post-doctoral research associate at the
		University of Pennsylvania. In August 2009, he joined the Indian
		Institute of Science where he is an Assistant Professor at the
		Department of Computer Science and Automation. A paper that he
		co-authored won the ACM SIGBED best paper award at EMSOFT 2008. He is
		a recipient of faculty awards from Microsoft Research India and IBM in
		the form of unrestricted research grants. His advisees have received
		fellowships and awards from IBM, Google India, and Computer Society of
		India.
