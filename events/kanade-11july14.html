<h1>Current trends in programming languages and research</h1>
<b>Speaker:</b> Prof. Aditya Kanade, CSA, IISc<br>
<b>Date:</b> July 11, 2014
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
This is an exciting time for research in programming languages. Many
recent innovations ranging from smart devices and cloud/web to online
education and end-user programming are throwing up foundational
challenges for programming languages technologies. In this talk, I
will review these recent innovations and identify the central role of
programming languages in supporting them. I will pose some of the
foundational research problems in this setting. The talk will then
discuss a couple of our recent contributions in this space: (1) formal
analysis of concurrent Android applications [PLDI'14] and (2)
automated program repair [ICSE'14].

<h3>Speaker bio</h3>
<p>
Dr. Aditya Kanade obtained a PhD from the Indian Institute of
Technology Bombay in 2007, and a BE from the Government College of
Engineering Pune in 2002, both in computer science and engineering.
From 2007 to 2009, he was a post-doctoral research associate at the
University of Pennsylvania. In August 2009, he joined the Indian
Institute of Science where he is an Assistant Professor at the
Department of Computer Science and Automation. A paper that he
co-authored won the ACM SIGBED best paper award at EMSOFT 2008. He is
