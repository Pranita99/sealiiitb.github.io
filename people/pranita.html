<h1>Biographical Sketch</h1>

<p>Pranita is an MS student at IIIT Bangalore in the Department of Computer Science, working under the Software Engineering and Analysis Lab. Prior to joining IIIT Bangalore, she worked for two years at Cognizant as a Test Automation Engineer, gaining hands-on experience in software testing and verification.

Her research interests include Software Testing and Verification, Formal Methods in Software Engineering, Model-Based Testing for Web Services, Automated API Testing & Verification, RESTful API Specification and Validation, Type Systems and Program Analysis, and Automated Test Case Generation for Software Systems.She is currently developing a Type Checker for API Specification Languages, which plays a crucial role in ensuring type safety and correctness in formal API specifications. This type checker seamlessly integrates with an automated test case generation algorithm, forming a powerful pipeline for verifying RESTful Web Services. The structured approach enhances software reliability, reducing ambiguities in API definitions and streamlining the testing process.</p>

Beyond academics, she enjoys traveling to new places , reading books at an alarming speed, and geeking out over the latest gadgets like a true tech enthusiast.
