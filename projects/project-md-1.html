		<h2>Verification and validation of architectures for embedded software</h2>

		<p>
		 We work with AADL (Architecture Analysis and Description Language), an
		industry standard language for specifying architectures for embedded
		software and systems. AADL follows the component-connector paradigm
		and has components to model platform, hardware and application
		software components. Event/data ports connect components and
		properties and flows can be used to describe architecture related
		properties of components, sub-systems and system.
		</p>
		<p>
		We have developed a framework for safety validation of safety critical
		systems using AADL system architecture models. Our framework includes
		algorithms for automatic generation of test cases (property-based and
		coverage criteria based) from AADL models and also generation of test
		cases from fault models described in AADL. The framework has been
		validated on an AADL benchmark system Isolette and on two large
		avionics systems.
		</p>
		<p>
		We are also working on developing an Event-B semantics for AADL
		architecture models. Such a semantics can be used to prove several
		non-functional requirements about architecture models specified using
		AADL paving way for formally verifying architecture models of embedded
		software.
