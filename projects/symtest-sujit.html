		<h2>Symbolic Testing of Embedded Software</h2>

	<p align='justify'>
	In test case generation methods based on symbolic testing and/or 
	model checking, the primary emphasis is on covering code/model 
	elements and not on optimising test sequence length. However, 
	in certain domains, e.g. embedded systems, GUI, networking software,
	testing process may involve interaction with other physical
	subsystems, possibly remotely situated. Thus, test sequence length 
	may have important implications on the cost of testing. In this 
	project, we design SymTest, a novel framework for test sequence 
	generation for testing embedded systems. SymTest selects <i>good</i>
	 control flow paths so as to generate shorter test sequences. In 
	 case of unsatisfiability, SymTest explores the neighbouring paths 
	 using backtracking and heuristics. SymTest is distinctive w.r.t. 
	 other related methods in its attempt to generate shorter test 
	 sequences while searching for feasible paths. The other novelty is 
	 that SymTest allows plugging in heuristics in a flexible way, a 
	 feature because of which we call SymTest a framework and not an 
	 algorithm. Part of SymTest's power is in its extensibility to 
	 seamlessly accommodate more heuristics, thus enhancing its ability 
	 to generate shorter test sequences with economy of effort. Our 
	 experiments with SymTest show that SymTest achieves significantly 
	 shorter test sequences, with comparatively higher test coverage, 
	 as compared with other methods.
