		<h2>Other projects in testing and verification of embedded control software</h2>
		<p>
		We have worked on/currently working on several other projects
		involving testing and verification of different kinds of embedded
		control software. The following is a list of the project with a brief
		description of the same:
		<ol type="a">
		<li>
			 Verifying GPU instructions in Coq: This project formalizes a
			small but complete set of GPU instructions in Coq theorem prover. We
			are working on proving that any program written using these
			instructions will be correct, in terms of its semantics captured in
			Coq. Our work involves coming up with Coq semantics for vertex shaders
			and fragment shaders and proving some properties of these shader
			programs.	
		</li>
		<li>
		 	WCET estimation of control code: We have come up with a simple
			algorithm to estimate the worst case execution time for control code
			written as per the IEC 61131-3 standard. Our approach uses abstract
			interpretation based techniques with interval domain and congruent
			domain abstraction for the IEC 61131-3 programs and considers a few
			relevant controller platform parameters for WCET estimation.
		</li>
		<li> 
			Static program analysis for secure element code: We have used the
			CLANG analyzer to estimate vulnerability patterns in the C code
			written for secure element chip used in mobile phones. Our
			vulnerability patterns detection tool can be used to minimize the
			manual load during audits for passing CC and other certifications
			necessary for such code.
		</li>
		<li>
			Method level power estimation of mobile applications: Large mobile
			applications consume a lot of power, which can be saved by cleverly
			using wakelocks. Intelligent use of wakelocks, at the level of methods
			in an app code can result in power saving. We have come up with an
			aspect-oriented programming approach to estimate method level power
			consumption, which in turn, can be used to design wake-locks
			accurately. Our approach has been tested in two large in-house
			projects involving Samsung mobile apps.
		</li>
